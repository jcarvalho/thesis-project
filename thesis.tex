\section{Introduction}

For many years, entrerprise applications were developed using
two-tiered architectures. In such architectures, there was typically a
mainframe with great computational power.

Long-Lived Transactions were first described in
1981 as ``[..] transactions with lifetimes of a few days or
weeks''\cite{gray1981transaction}. At the time, the author said that the
solution for this

Describe that the solution will be build on top of the Fenix Framework
core, plus JVSTM, making it agnostic to the specific persistence
backend in use.
